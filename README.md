- No need to login to Kraken - start trading immediately, always
- Integrated update mechanism - get latest version from GitHub
- Notifies you once order is closed and trade successfully executed
- Fully usable with buttons - no need to enter commands manually
- Supports all currencies available on Kraken (configurable)
- Change bot settings via bot
- Following Kraken functionality is implemented
    - Create a buy / sell order (type _limit_)
    - Lookup last trade price for currencies
    - Show all your assets
    - Current market value of assets (one or all)
    - Show / close open orders
    - Sell all assets for current market price
    - Deposit & withdraw
    - Show real-time charts
    - List history of closed orders
    - Check state of Kraken API

## Files
In the following list you will find details about all the files that the project consists of - and if they are necessary to deploy or not.

- __.gitignore__: Only relevant if you use [git](https://git-scm.com) as your Source Code Management. If you put a filename in that file, then that file will not be commited to the repository. If you don't intend to code yourself, the file is _not needed_.
- __\_config.yml__: Automatically genereated file from GitHub that holds the theme-name for the [project page](https://endogen.github.io/Telegram-Kraken-Bot). This file is _not needed_.
- __config.json__: The configuration file for this bot. This file is _needed_.
- __demo.gif__: Animated image for GitHub `README.md` to demonstrate how the bot looks and behaves. This file is _not needed_.
- __kraken.key__: The content of this file has to remain secret! _Do not tell anybody anything about the content_. The file consists of two lines. First line: API key. Second line: API secret (you get both from Kraken). This file is _needed_.
- __Procfile__: This file is only necessary if you want to host the bot on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Otherwise, this file is _not needed_.
- __README.md__: The readme file you are reading right now. Includes instructions on how to run and use the bot. The file is _not needed_.
- __requirements.txt__: This file holds all dependencies (Python modules) that are required to run the bot. Once all dependencies are installed, the file is _not needed_ anymore. If you need to know how to install the dependencies from this file, take a look at [the details](#dependencies).
- __telegram\_python\_bot.py__: The bot itself. This file has to be executed with Python to run. For more details, see [the installation](#installation). This file is _needed_.

So as one can see, these are the files that are important to run the bot:

- `kraken.key` (API Secret)
- `config.json` (Configuration)
- `telegram_kraken_bot.py` (Bot itself)

## Configuration
Before starting up the bot you have to take care of some settings. You need to edit two files:

### config.json
This file holds the configuration for your bot. You have to at least edit the values for __user_id__ and __bot_token__. After a value has been changed you have to restart the bot for the applied changes to take effect.

- __user_id__: Your Telegram user ID. The bot will only reply to messages from this user. If you don't know your user ID, send a message to Telegram bot `userinfobot` and he will reply your ID (use the ID, not the username)
- __bot_token__: The token that identifies your bot. You will get this from Telegram bot `BotFather` when you create your bot. If you don't know how to register your bot, follow [these instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot)
- __base_currency__: The base fiat currency you are trading from / to. Theoretically you could enter any coin here but right now only fiat currencies are supported by this bot. Currently the following are supported by Kraken: `EUR`, `USD`, `CAD`, `GBR`, `JPY` and `KRW`.
- __check_trade__: If `true` then every order (already existing or newly created) will be monitored by a job and if the status changes to `closed` (which means that the trade was successfully executed) you will be notified by a message
- __check\_trade\_time__: Time in seconds to check for order status change (see setting `check_trade`)
- __update_url__: URL to the latest GitHub version of the script. This is needed for the update functionality. Per default this points to my repository and if you don't have your own repo with some changes then you can use the default value
- __update_hash__: Hash of the latest version of the script. __Please don't change this__. Will be set automatically after updating
- __update_check__: (_currently not used_) If `true`, then periodic update-checks (see also option `update_time` for timespan) are performed. If there is a bot-update available then you will be notified by a message
- __update_time__: (_currently not used_) Time in seconds to check for bot-updates. `update_check` has to be enabled
- __send_error__: If `true`, then all errors that happen will trigger a message to the user. If `false`, only the important errors will be send and timeout errors of background jobs will not be send
- __show\_access\_denied__: If `true`, the owner and the user who tries to access the bot will both be notified. If `false`, no one will be notified. Set to `false` if you get spammed with `Access denied` messages
- __used_coins__: List of currencies to use in the bot. You can choose from all available currencies at Kraken: `XBT`, `BCH`, `DASH`, `EOS`, `ETC`, `ETH`, `GNO`, `ICN`, `LTC`, `MLN`, `REP`, `USDT`, `XDG`, `XLM`, `XMR`, `XRP`, `ZEC`
- __coin_charts__: Dictionary of all available currencies with their corresponding chart URLs. If you want to add new ones, get the plain URL of the chart, save it with [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com) and add the new URL to the config file
- __log\_to\_file__: If `true`, debug-output to console will be saved in file `debug.log`
- __log_level__: Has to be an __integer__. Choose the log-level depending on this: DEBUG = `10`, INFO = `20`, WARNING = `30`, ERROR = `40`, CRITICAL = `50`
- __history_items__: Number of history trades to display simultaneously
- __retries__: If `true`, then issued Kraken API requests will be retried if they return any kind of server error. In most cases this is very helpfull since at the second or third time the request will most likely make it through. See also option `retries_counter` to set number of retries
- __retries_counter__: Number of times a Kraken API call will be retried if option `retries` is enabled

### kraken.key
This file holds two keys that are necessary in order to communicate with Kraken. Both keys have to be considered __secret__ and you should be the only one that knows them.

<a name="api-keys"></a>
If you don't know where to get / how to generate the keys:

1. Login to Kraken
2. Click on `Settings`
3. Click on `API`
4. Click on `Generate New Key`
5. Enter `Telegram-Kraken-Bot` in `Key Description`
6. Enter `4` in `Nonce Window` (or just use the default value)
7. Select all available permissions at `Key Permissions`
8. Click on `Generate Key`

When you have your Kraken API keys, open the file `kraken.key` and replace `some_api_key` (first line) with the value of `API Key` and `some_private_key` (second line) with the value of `Private Key`.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation
In order to run the bot you need to execute the script `telegram_kraken_bot.py`. If you don't have any idea where to host it, take a look at [Where to host Telegram Bots](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki/Where-to-host-Telegram-Bots). __Since you have to provide sensitive data (Kraken API keys) to use the bot, i would only host this script on a server that you own__. You can also run the script locally on your computer for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
##### Python version
You have to use __Python 3.6__ to execute the script (because of enum method `auto()`). If you would like to use Python 3.4 or 3.5, you have to remove `auto` from imports and set the values in `WorkflowEnum` and `KeyboardEnum` yourself. Python 2.x is __not__ supported.

<a name="dependencies"></a>
##### Installing needed modules from `requirements.txt`
Install a set of module-versions that is known to work together for sure (__highly recommended__):
```shell
pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Install newest versions of needed modules
If you want to install the newest version of the needed modules, do the following:
```shell
pip3.6 install python-telegram-bot -U
pip3.6 install beautifulsoup4 -U
pip3.6 install krakenex -U
```

### Starting up
To start the script, execute
```shell
python3.6 telegram_kraken_bot.py &
```

## Usage
If you configured the bot correctly and execute the script, you should see some checks that the bot performes. After that a welcome message from the bot will be shown along with the information if you are using the latest version. There should also be a custom keyboard that shows you all the available commands. Click on a button to execute the command or type the command in manually.

:warning: In general, while entering the volume, make sure that you don't use smaller values then Kraken supports. Take a look at the [order limits for various coins](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/205893708-What-is-the-minimum-order-size-). Otherwise the request to Kraken will lead to an error. These values are also present in the configuration file at key `min_order_size`.

### Available commands
##### Related to Kraken
- `/trade`: Start a workflow that leads to the creation of a new order of type _limit_ (buy or sell)
- `/orders`: Show all open orders (buy and sell) and close a specific one or all if desired
- `/balance`: Show all assets and the volume available to trade if open orders exist already
- `/price`: Return last trade price for the selected crypto-currency
- `/value`: Show current market value of chosen currency or all assets
- `/chart`: Show a trading chart for the chosen currency
- `/history`: Show history of closed trades
- `/funding`: Deposit or withdraw (only to wallet, not SEPA) funds
- `/state`: Show performance of Kraken API

##### Related to bot
The following commands are available as sub-commands for command `/bot`

- `/update`: Update the bot to the latest version on GitHub
- `/restart`: Restart the bot
- `/shutdown`: Shutdown the bot
- `/settings`: Show and change bot settings
- `/reload`: Reload custom command keyboard

If you want to show a list of available commands as you type, talk to Telegram user `BotFather` and send the command `/setcommands`. Then choose the bot you want to activate the list for and after that send the list of commands with description. Something like this:
```
trade - buy or sell assets
orders - show or close orders
balance - show all your assets
price - show current price for asset
value - calculate value for assets
chart - display trading charts
history - show completed trades
funding - deposit or withdraw currencies
bot - update, restart or shutdown
```

## Development
I know that it is unusual to have the whole source code in just one file. At some point i should have been switching to object orientation and multiple files but i kind of like the idea to have it all in just one file and object orientation would only blow up the code. This also makes the `/update` command much simpler :)

### Todo
##### Priority 1
- [x] Add command `/history` that shows executed trades
- [x] Add command `/chart` to show TradingView Chart Widget website
- [x] Add command `/funding` to deposit / withdraw funds
- [ ] Add command `/alert` to be notified once a specified price is reached
- [x] Add possibility to sell __all__ assets immediately to current market value
- [x] Enable to trade every currency that Kraken supports
- [x] Add possibility to change settings via bot

##### Priority 2
- [x] Optimize code to call Kraken API less often
- [x] Automatically check for updates (with configurable timespan)
- [ ] Create webhook-version of this bot

##### Priority 3
- [ ] Add command `/stats` that shows statistics
- [ ] Closed order notifications: Show gain / loss if association between orders possible
- [ ] Integrate other market places then Kraken

## Troubleshooting
In case you experience any issues, please take a look at this section to check if it is described here. If not, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Endogen/Telegram-Kraken-Bot/issues/new).

:warning: It depends on the error but it is possible that a request to Kraken will throw an error and still be executed correctly.

:warning: Sometimes it happens that a specific command will not trigger any action (no response from the bot on button click). If that happens, try to restart the bot and execute the command again.

- __Error `Invalid nonce`__: It might happen pretty often that Kraken replies with this error. If you want to understand what a nonce is, [read the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce). This error happens mostly if you use different Telegram clients. Maybe you issued some commands on your laptop and then switched to your smartphone? That would be a typical scenario where this might happen. Or you didn't use the bot for a long time. To resolve it, just execute the command again. It should work the second time - meaning you press the keyboard button again. Unfortunately there is not much i can do. The correct behavior would be to have one Kraken API key-pair for one device (one for your smartphone and one for your laptop). Unfortunately there is no way to identify the client. You can play around with the nonce value in your Kraken account (take a look at the [settings for the generated key-pair](#api-keys)). If you are really annoyed by this then here is what you could try: Create some key-pairs (5 might do it) and then, before you call the Kraken API, randomly choose one of the keys and use it till the next Kraken API call is made.
- __Error `Service unavailable`__: If you get this error then because Kraken fucked up again. That happens regularly. It means that their API servers are not available or the performance is degraded because the load on the servers is too high. Nothing you can do here - try again later. If you want to have details on the API server performance, go to [Kraken Status](https://status.kraken.com).

## Disclaimer
I use this bot personally to trade on Kraken so i guess it's kind of stable but __if you use it, then you are doing this on your own responsibility__ !!! I can not be made responsible for lost coins or other stuff that might happen due to some fuckup within the code. Use at your own risk!
